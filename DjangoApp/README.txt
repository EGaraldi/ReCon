The files and folders related to the Django App are:
db.sqlite3
contraints folder
manage.py
templates
run.sh
ReCon folder

Other files are for the script which is still incomplete.

It's recommended to use a virtualenv before setting up the app, the details of which can be found here (it's a small procedure):
https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/

There is a requirements.txt, run the following to install all the requirements:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3)

To run the app just run:
./run.sh
