====================================================
CoReCon: open Collection of Reionization Constraints
====================================================


**CoReCon** is an open collection of constraints on various physical
quantities linked to the *Epoch of Reionization (EoR)*.

It is built to be easily complemented by contribution from the scientific
community, thanks to a simple data form that supports two different ways of 
input data.

CoReCon takes care of loading and interpreting the data, and presenting them 
in an organic and ready-to-use way. It also implement simple slicing capabilities,
which allow to perform simple data filtering.
