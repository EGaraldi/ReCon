Adding your constraint
""""""""""""""""""""""
CoReCon has been developed with in mind the contribution from the community. In order 
to add a constraint to the available one, we provide an empty :ref:`DataEntryTemplate`.

In order to make your new constraint available to the community, you can submit a pull 
request to the CoReCon repository_ or simply send it via email to the code author.
