ReCon: open collection of Reionization Constraints
==================================================

**ReCon** is an open collection of constraints on various physical
quantities linked to the *Epoch of Reionization (EoR)*.

It is built to be easily complemented by contribution from the scientific
community, thanks to a simple data form that supports two different ways of 
input data.

ReCon takes care of loading and interpreting the data, and presenting them 
in an organic and ready-to-use way. It also implement simple slicing capabilities,
which allow to perform simple data filtering.

ReCon has been developed with in mind the contribution from the community. In order 
to add a constraint to the available one, we provide an empty :ref:`DataEntryTemplate`.
