"""
Uses a large-volume semi-numerical simulation of reionization topology combined with 1D radiative transfer through high-resolution 
hydrodynamical simulations of the high-redshift universe to construct models of quasar transmission spectra during reionization.
Uses a Bayesian method to jointly constrain the neutral fraction of the universe and the quasar lifetime from individual quasar spectra. 
This methodology is applied to the spectra of ULAS J1120+0641 and ULAS J1342+0928.
