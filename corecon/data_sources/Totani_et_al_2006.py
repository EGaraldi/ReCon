'''
Based on spectral modeling of the optical afterglow to the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050904 at z = 6.3. The spectrum is taken by the Subaru Telescope.
The damping wing redward of the Lyman break can be fit either by a damped Ly alpha system with a column density of log (N_HI/cm^{-2}) ~ 21.6 
at a redshift close to the detected metal absorption lines (z_metal = 6.295), or by almost neutral IGM extending to a slightly higher redshift 
of z_{IGM,u} ~ 6.36. Constraint on the neutral fraction is obtained by the damping wing modeling.
